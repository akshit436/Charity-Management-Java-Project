                                        Rula* was only four years old when an airstrike hit her school in Syria. Luckily, Rula was inside the school when the airstrike occurred so she was one of the few children who survived, but most of her classmates and friends were not as lucky. She has not been back to school since.
                                        This was the final straw for Rula's father. He realized their home was no longer safe, so he took his wife and four young children to the nearby city of Raqqa in hopes of a better life. Rula and her older sister Hussain* and brother Randa* went to school for three days before another airstrike occurred and they stopped going to school completely. Life in Raqqa was hard, and the children often felt like they were in prison.
                                        "We stayed in Raqqa for 3 years but we were like prisoners in the house because it was too dangerous to go outside," Rula said. "There was no water, no food, no electricity and there were airstrikes all the time."
                                        Eventually Rula and her family left Syria for good and headed toward Turkey, where they met a smuggler who brought them to a boat that would take them to Greece.
                                        Rula's father, a fisherman in his old village, drove the boat and they arrived safely in Greece, ready to start a new life.
                                        Things are better in Greece, but they are not perfect. Rula's younger sister Dima*, 3, has never known anything but violence and still flinches whenever an airplane flies overhead. Save the Children is working with children like Rula and Dima to provide them the mental and emotional support they need through our Child Friendly Spaces. Eventually Rula's family would like to settle in Germany, but for now Rula is just looking forward to going back to school.

                                        <h2 class="color2"><strong>T</strong>rue<span>Story 2</span></h2>
                                        <div class="pad_bot1"><figure><img src="images/page1_img2.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>
                                        . <a class="color0" href="http://blog.templatemonster.com/2011/07/18/free-website-template-charity-jquery-slider-typography/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"></a>  By the time Samuel* was 15 he had already lost his father to war, his mother and grandmother to Ebola, and his leg to a tragic accident. He was an orphan who was cast aside by his community and locked away by his remaining family. Samuel had nothing and no one cared.

                                        Samuel's accident was small, something that could happen to anyone. One day while he was walking to a farm he slipped and fell. He thought nothing of it. Until three days later when his foot was so swollen he could not walk, and eventually his skin burst from the pressure. He traveled from his home in Sierra Leone to a doctor in Guinea to seek treatment. The journey was long and painful and the doctor he saw told Samuel the injury was the cause of witchcraft. He returned to his village no better off and confronted by a terrifying incident – Ebola had made its way to Samuel's home.
                                        "One week after I returned my grandmother died. Three weeks after that my mother died too. Many people in my village were dying all around me. Another woman who used to care for me also died. Children too. I was so afraid."
                                        One month later Save the Children came to Samuel's town and made sure he was brought to a hospital to receive proper care for his foot injury. There he met Dr. Juan, the senior health advisor for Save the Children, who gave Samuel the news that his foot was too bad by this point and had to be amputated. However, Samuel was not afraid.
                                        "I wasn’t afraid. I had been in so much pain for such a long time and I knew that after the operation I would get better," Samuel said. "Immediately after the operation I felt better. I remember thinking that when I get better I will still be able to have a good future. Be someone important in society."
                                        After the operation Samuel went to live with his aunt in a home Save the Children found for them. He was given all the amenities he needed for his new life – including a wheelchair and crutches so he could get around his new community and eventually so he could go back to school. The community rallied around Samuel and supported him and his aunt while they settled into their new life together. Samuel’s doctor also made sure he had the support he needed to continue getting stronger.
                                        "Dr. Juan was the one who taught me exercises to become fit and strong again. So I can walk again – start my life again. He has been so good to me. The community have been very supportive too. They help get me around."
                                        Although Samuel has experienced so much loss at such a young age, he is so excited that he still has a future ahead of him. He has now been able to return to school and has made many new friends. He has dreams of being a successful banker.

                                        By all accounts the odds were against Estrella to succeed. She lives in a rural, poverty stricken town in Kentucky in a single-parent household, and she hasn’t had the stability of attending the same school for more than one year. Her reading scores were low and she was acting out in class. She would rather spend her time outside playing than doing her homework, and she lacked the confidence and structure she needed to succeed.
                                        Now with the help of Save the Children afterschool programs this has all changed for Estrella. She has learned to love reading and considers it one of her favorite hobbies, has improved her grades and no longer acts out in class.
                                        The afterschool program allowed Estrella to have access to books every day, a luxury to many children from low-income families, and the tools she needed to increase her vocabulary and writing skills. She also learned about making healthy food choices and leading a healthy lifestyle, something lacking in many rural parts of America.
                                        "I like afterschool because it is fun and you get to go with Mr. Gibson to learn about healthy choices," Estrella said. "I like reading now and taking quizzes is not as hard since I started going to Save the Children."
                                        Although Estrella still doesn’t know what she wants to be when she grows up, she now has the opportunity to be whatever she sets her mind to. Through Save the Children programs she not only gained the knowledge she would need to succeed in school, but the confidence she would need to succeed in life.
